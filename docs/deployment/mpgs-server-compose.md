# MPGS Server Docker Compose Deployment

This deployment target runs `mpgs-server` with Postgres and an optional Caddy reverse proxy.

## Build Locally

Build the service image on a local development machine or CI runner. Do not build on the VPS.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.mpgs-server -t mpgs-server:local .
docker save mpgs-server:local -o mpgs-server-local.tar
```

PowerShell users can run the checked local build script instead:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File deploy/scripts/build-mpgs-server-image.ps1 `
  -ImageTag mpgs-server:local `
  -OutputTar mpgs-server-local.tar
```

For an Arm VPS such as `ora_vps`, build a `linux/arm64` image locally or in CI before uploading:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File deploy/scripts/build-mpgs-server-image.ps1 `
  -ImageTag mpgs-server:local `
  -OutputTar mpgs-server-linux-arm64.tar `
  -UseBuildx `
  -Platform linux/arm64
```

Upload `mpgs-server-local.tar` plus the `deploy/` directory to the server, then load the image there:

```bash
docker load -i mpgs-server-local.tar
```

## Configure

Create a server-side `.env` from the example:

```bash
cp deploy/mpgs-server.env.example deploy/.env
```

Set at least:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `CADDY_DOMAIN` if using the Caddy profile

The Compose `.env` only locates the config directory indirectly through the compose file and sets container-level values such as the Postgres container credentials. Service settings and service secrets live in TOML files under `deploy/config`.

For first-run browser setup, create a setup token config:

```bash
cp deploy/config/setup.toml.example deploy/config/setup.toml
```

Set `setup.token_hash` to a SHA-256 hash in the format expected by `mpgs-server`:

```text
sha256:<base64-no-padding sha256(setup-token)>
```

The setup token allows the first-run setup API to write `deploy/config/active/service.toml` and `deploy/config/active/secrets.toml`. After setup writes active config, normal management access must use the admin token, not the setup token.

Do not put the raw setup token in `.env`, Postgres, docs, or logs.

Management configuration changes are written under `deploy/config/pending` first and report `restartRequired=true`. The service does not copy active secrets into pending files for service identity edits, so saving non-secret settings must not clear Steam, LLM, R2, or admin credentials.

`/api/v1/admin/restart` validates pending service configuration, requires admin authentication and explicit confirmation, then gracefully exits the service process so Docker Compose can restart it. It does not use the Docker socket, a restart-helper container, or arbitrary host commands. On the next startup, the service validates pending service configuration before promoting it to active.

For manual offline configuration instead, create the active secrets file:

```bash
cp deploy/config/active/secrets.toml.example deploy/config/active/secrets.toml
```

Edit:

- `deploy/config/active/service.toml` for non-sensitive service identity and bind settings.
- `deploy/config/active/secrets.toml` for the Postgres URL, admin token hash, session secret, and future server-side secrets.

For the default Compose network, `deploy/config/active/secrets.toml` should use:

```toml
[database]
url = "postgres://mpgs:change-this-postgres-password@postgres:5432/mpgs"
```

Keep the database password in `deploy/.env` and `deploy/config/active/secrets.toml` in sync.

Set `admin.token_hash` to a SHA-256 hash in the format expected by `mpgs-server`:

```text
sha256:<base64-no-padding sha256(admin-token)>
```

Set `admin.session_secret` to a long random value used to sign short-lived admin session cookies. Do not put the raw admin token in `.env`, Postgres, docs, or logs.

Do not put Steam, LLM, R2, setup token, or admin token secrets in Postgres.

## Start Without Public HTTPS

This binds the service only to localhost on the host, which is suitable behind another reverse proxy:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/compose.yml up -d
curl http://127.0.0.1:4310/healthz
curl http://127.0.0.1:4310/api/v1/service-info
```

## Start With Caddy

Point DNS for `CADDY_DOMAIN` at the server first. Then run:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env \
  -f deploy/compose.yml \
  -f deploy/compose.caddy.yml \
  --profile caddy \
  up -d
```

The public client should use HTTPS:

```bash
curl https://$CADDY_DOMAIN/healthz
curl https://$CADDY_DOMAIN/api/v1/service-info
```

## Remote Deploy Verification

After the image archive exists locally and the server has its real `deploy/.env` plus either `deploy/config/setup.toml` or active service config, the checked remote deploy script can upload the image archive and compose assets, load the image, start Compose, and verify both `/healthz` and `/api/v1/service-info`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File deploy/scripts/deploy-mpgs-server-remote.ps1 `
  -RemoteHost ora_vps `
  -RemotePath ~/mpgs-server `
  -ImageTar mpgs-server-linux-arm64.tar `
  -UseCaddy `
  -PublicBaseUrl https://$env:CADDY_DOMAIN
```

The remote script uploads only compose files, Caddy config, example TOML files, and the image archive. It does not overwrite remote `deploy/.env`, active secrets, or active service config. The server-side steps are limited to `docker load`, `docker compose up -d`, `curl` probes, and `docker compose ps`.

## Operational Boundary

- The VPS only runs `docker load` and `docker compose up`; it must not compile Rust or build the image.
- The service container runs database migrations on startup.
- The mounted config directory is writable so setup and later management APIs can write TOML configuration files; `.env` still must not contain service secrets.
- Managed restart relies on the Compose `restart: unless-stopped` policy and service self-exit.
- Public `/healthz` is intentionally minimal and does not expose configuration or secrets.
- Empty public catalog state is healthy; public library population belongs to later discovery/admin slices.
